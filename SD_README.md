# System_Design
Concepts aims to build systems that are reliable, effective, and maintainable.  

- System design borrows many great concepts from distributed systems. Apart from distributed systems, some basic concepts on computer networking and operating systems are also helpful before taking this course.  

## distributed system  
- A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.

- Performance is the degree to which a software system or component meets its objectives for timeliness.
- Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
  - If we build a distributed system, we can split and store the data in multiple computers, and distribute the processing work.
    - Vertical scaling refers to the approach of scaling a system by adding resources (memory, CPU, disk, etc.) to a single node. Meanwhile, horizontal scaling refers to the approach of scaling by adding more nodes to the system.
- Availability is the probability of a system to work as required, when required, during a mission.
- Redundancy is one of the widely used mechanisms to achieve higher availability. It refers to storing data into multiple, redundant computers. So, when one computer fails, we can efficiently switch to another one. This way, weâ€™ll prevent our customers from experiencing this failure.
